# Download script generator for QCD fragments for SVJ

The script requires `pip install minimal-cernsso` ( https://github.com/tklijnsma/minimal-cernsso).

Simply run with `python get.py`, and a script `download_fragments.sh` should be generated.

Copy this script to any CMSSW distribution you have setup and run it.
